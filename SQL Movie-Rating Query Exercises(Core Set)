Question 1
Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg. 
Note: Your queries are executed using SQLite, so you must conform to the SQL constructs supported by SQLite.

SELECT Movie.title
FROM Movie
WHERE  Movie.Director = "Steven Spielberg";

Question 2
Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order.

SELECT DISTINCT Movie.year
FROM Rating, Movie
WHERE Rating.stars < 6 AND Rating.stars > 3
AND Movie.mID = Rating.mID
ORDER BY Movie.year;

Question 3
Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings. 

SELECT DISTINCT Movie.title
FROM Movie, Rating
WHERE Movie.mID NOT IN(
SELECT Movie.mID
FROM Movie,Rating
WHERE Movie.mID = Rating.mID);

Question 4
Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date. 

SELECT Reviewer.name
FROM Reviewer, Rating
WHERE ratingDate IS NULL
AND Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID;

Question 5
Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars. 

SELECT DISTINCT Reviewer.name, Movie.title, Rating.stars, Rating.ratingDate
FROM Movie, Reviewer, Rating
WHERE Reviewer.rID = Rating.rID AND Rating.mID = Movie.mID 
ORDER BY Reviewer.name, Movie.title, Rating.stars

Question 6
For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie. 

SELECT Reviewer.name, Movie.title
FROM Rating R1, Rating R2, Reviewer, Movie
WHERE R1.rID= R2.rID
AND R1.RatingDate < R2.RatingDate
AND R1.mID = R2.mID
AND R1.stars < R2.stars
AND R2.mID = movie.mID
AND R2.rID = reviewer.rID ;

Question 7
For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of stars that movie received. Return the movie title and number of stars. Sort by movie title. 

SELECT Movie.title, MAX(Rating.stars)
FROM  Movie, Rating
WHERE Movie.mID = Rating.mID
GROUP BY Movie.mID
ORDER BY Movie.title;

Question 8
For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the difference between highest and lowest ratings given to that movie. Sort by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title. 

SELECT Movie.title, Max(Rating.stars) - MIN(Rating.stars)
FROM Movie, Rating
WHERE Movie.mID = Rating.mID
GROUP BY Movie.mID
ORDER BY Max(Rating.stars) - MIN(Rating.stars) DESC, Movie.title

Question 9
Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. (Make sure to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. Don't just calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.) 

SELECT AVG(
SELECT AVG(Rating.stars)
FROM Movie, Rating
WHERE Movie.mID = Rating.mID
AND Movie.year < 1980
GROUP BY Movie.mID
) - AVG(
SELECT AVG(Rating.stars)
FROM Movie, Rating
WHERE Movie.mID = Rating.mID
AND Movie.year > 1980
GROUP BY Movie.mID
)
